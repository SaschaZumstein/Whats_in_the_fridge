# Whats in the fridge?
Projekt Bildverarbeitung 1

This project implements a smart vision system that captures images from a fridge and detects specific food items using object detection. The system uses a esp32-camera to periodically capture fridge contents and identifies the following items:

- Bottle  
- Carrot  
- Yoghurt  
- Peppers  

## Features

- Automatic image capture from a fridge-mounted camera
- Real-time object detection using a YOLO-based model
- Supports detection of bottle, carrot, yoghurt and peppers
- Saves annotated images and detection results
